## [1.0.0] - Quantum Initialization 

### Added
- **Sci-Fi Terminal UI**: A completely overhauled, massive terminal interface running on `rich`. Featuring full-width ASCII art banners, hex-coded quantum color palettes, and matrix-grid layouts.
- **Intelligent Engine**: Full-throttle asynchronous networking kernel enabling rapid, multi-threaded fetching with seamless protocol fallbacks.
- **IPFS Protocol Bridging**: Native routing hooks for `ipfs://` schema links, bridging command-line architecture to the decentralized web.
- **Advanced CLI Commands**: Added deep networking plugins for instantaneous DNS telemetry (`fluxion dns`), target Port Mapping (`fluxion scan`), remote SSL certificate extraction (`fluxion cert`), and TCP Latency profiling (`fluxion ping`).
- **Resilience Core**: Automated data-integrity hashing, stealth connection profiles, smart chunk-resuming capabilities, and eliminated all blind try-except vulnerabilities across the primary application execution loop.

### Changed
- **Branding Upgrade**: Complete modernization of project identity, removing standard logging formats in favor of high-fidelity HUD rendering. 
- **Author Identity**: Fully migrated author credits and maintainership configurations to `ScorpioCodeX`.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Removed PyPI legacy configuration structures, optimizing documentation and packaging explicitly for direct GitHub or pipx installations.

### Security
- **Strict TLS Enforcement**: Fortified download paths with absolute cryptography validation and visual cert-chain inspections.
- **Dependency Hardening**: Upgraded internal module logic to bypass local execution issues in `aiodns` affecting Windows systems.
